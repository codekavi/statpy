# StatPy
Statistical Python with GUI for building ML learning models and sequentially generating code

# Overview
Bring power and flexibility of Python to UI. Generate instant code as you build models 

The rate at which ML, DL and AI is moving into different fields, I see no reason for them to manually coded by writing the code one line or few lines at a time instead of building better models and tuning and rapid deployement into the pipeline.

My idea is to build a GUI where Data can be explored, models can be built. For everything you do, code should be instantly available and should be ready to deploy to the pipeline. 

I have been using JMP, it has simple and powerful UI and has ability to generate code. However the rate of progress for Deep learingin and AI is limited due to few developers. If we can open source this and use the power of shared building for the community. This would be greate for everyone.  

# StatPy
StatPy would have UI based system with ablity to generate deployment ready python code
